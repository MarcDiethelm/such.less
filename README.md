such.less
=========

Such less. Many advance. So CSS. Wow.

## Why

Mainly to collect, standardize and share some amazing best practices we have found while using LessCSS for frontend projects, from small to huge. Also to brag about them a bit. Wow.

Imagine if you could just drop some modular less files into your project and define some variables to set up the typography, a grid, re-usable responsive layouts, get some styles for wireframing and of course many truly useful helpers.

This project aims to work as a collection of libraries. You set your configuration centrally in one file using less variables and then call the appropriate library mixins all in one place passing your variables into them. (After that you can tweak the libraries for your individual needs.)

Such less.

Todo: Maybe really separate default library code and user defined code. Integrate with less unlocks.

## Getting started

- Todo: Install with bower(?)
- Fill in the variables in `variables.less`
- Call the mixins you need in `project.less`

Now you've got a clean and manageable setup. Such nice. Wow.

After that go and make a mess in `elements.less`.

## TODO

- [ ] Mature the file file structure and architecture
- [ ] Plan a standard install mechanism (bower and/or npm)
- [ ] Build step
- [ ] Facilitate integration with external build setups. (grunt plugin?)
